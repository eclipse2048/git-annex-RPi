git-annex-RPi
=============

The git-annex binary including the assistant, compiled for ARMv6 
architecture (namely, the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/)). 

[Git-annex](http://git-annex.branchable.com/) is an awesome piece of 
software for syncing and keeping track of files. It comes with an assistant 
and a webapp to set up and sync repositories without the command line. Since 
the pre-compiled Debian packages for the Raspberry Pi and other ARM hardware 
come without these tools, I compiled the binary with the assistant myself. 

As of yet, the webapp will not compile on ARM due to the lack of a Haskell 
compiler that supports Template Haskell. The binary also comes without 
webdav. 

Latest version in this git: 4.20131002
